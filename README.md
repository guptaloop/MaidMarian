# README

Production README coming soon!

things to fix:
- refactor CSS - repetitive, a lot of code -- use vars?
	-- get the DIN PRO font
- re-style splash, login pages (buttons, font, etc)
- if on Stock A page and you use search to go to Stock B, the price chart does
	 not update to Stock B's data
- refactor Component structure
- fix the Stock Page when not logged in -- nav bar and order form
- add a currency symbol to any displayed price
