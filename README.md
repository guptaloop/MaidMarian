# README

Production README coming soon!

things to fix:
- refactor CSS - repetitive, a lot of code -- use vars?
	-- get the DIN PRO font
- re-style splash, login pages (buttons, font, etc)
- if on Stock A page and you use search to go to Stock B, the price chart does
	 not update to Stock B's data
- figure out what's going on with 'prices.slice(-1)[0].price' -- why can't I
		pull the last price ??
		-- the off:hover price chart calculations are off
- refactor Component structure
- fix the Stock Page when not logged in -- nav bar and order form
